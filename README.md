# RedRockTrails_DataAnalysis

This is a small project I made to learn skills in web scraping and data analysis. 
Using the beautifulsoup package I was able to scrape the website Redrockcanyonlv.org for data on their hikes.
I think used this information to do a small amount of exploritory data analysis. I also displayed a very practical use of K-Means Clustering.
